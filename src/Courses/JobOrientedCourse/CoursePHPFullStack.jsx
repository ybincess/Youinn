                        <h3><strong>Course Overview</strong></h3>
                        <p>Over the years, web application development was partitioned into silos like front-end developer,
                                server-side developer etc. Front-end developer focusing on User interface elements and related programming
                                whereas server-side guys focusing more on writing code which would run on the web and application servers.
                                Now the situation is changing with new disruptive technologies taking the world into their stride
                        </p>
                        <p>The explosion of startups and micro-businesses caused a wide set of skills to be needed as a benchmark.
                            In those, full stack web development is one. If we analyze the trend, Even though the need for Data Scientists & Analysts,
                            Big Data experts, AI is raising over past three years, it is not reaching the same demand level as a full stack developer
                           or a full stack engineer.
                       </p>
                        <p> The Full Stack Developer is the new Buzz in the Industry. For any niche things, the one who comes and conquer
                             first will have the edge.
