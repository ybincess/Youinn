                            <p>React (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a JavaScript library[3] for building user interfaces. 
                                It is maintained by Facebook and a community of individual developers and companies.
                             </p>   
                            <p>
                            React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications, 
                            as it is optimal for fetching rapidly changing data that needs to be recorded. However, 
                            fetching data is only the beginning of what happens on a web page, which is why complex 
                            React applications usually require the use of additional libraries for state management, 
                            routing, and interaction with an API; Redux, React Router and axios are respective examples of such libraries.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            React code is made of entities called components. Components can be rendered to a particular element in the DOM using the React DOM library. 
                            When rendering a component, one can pass in values that are known as "props".
